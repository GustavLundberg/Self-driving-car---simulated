# Self-driving-car---simulated

Here I will try and put the code from my model and the trained network with weights and paramters to be used in 
the autonomous mode in the simulator.

# Working progress

- Managed to get the car to run in autonomous mode with the network I've trained

# To do

- Learn git better

# Thougts and things tested

- It doesn't seem to matter if I put the drop out rate (keep_prob) to 0 or 1!!!
